=== Authentication

Both Facebook JavaScript SDK and normal OAuth2 flow is supported.
Below I show simple sample code.
You can also see http://github.com/nov/fb_graph_sample for more details Rails3 sample application.

==== JavaScript SDK

  fb_auth = FbGraph::Auth.new(YOUR_APP_ID, YOUR_APPLICATION_SECRET)
  fb_auth.client # => Rack::OAuth2::Client

  # get Facebook's auth cookie in advance using their JS SDK
  fb_auth.from_cookie(cookies)
  fb_auth.access_token # => Rack::OAuth2::AccessToken
  fb_auth.user         # => FbGraph::User (only basic attributes)
  fb_auth.user.fetch   # => fetch more details

==== Normal OAuth2 Flow

  # setup client
  client = fb_auth.client
  client.redirect_uri = "http://your.client.com/facebook/callback"

  # redirect user to facebook
  redirect_to client.authorize_uri(
    :scope => [:email, :read_stream, :offline_access]
  )

  # in callback
  client.authorization_code = params[:code]
  access_token = client.access_token!  # => Rack::OAuth2::AccessToken
  FbGraph::User.me(access_token).fetch # => FbGraph::User

=== Analytics

  app = FbGraph::Application.new(YOUR_APP_ID, :secret => YOUR_APPLICATION_SECRET)
  app.insights # => Array of FbGraph::Insight

== Note on Patches/Pull Requests
 
* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
